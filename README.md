# Separate-Compilation-CudaFiles
This code explains how to divide a large CUDA code into multiple files and then compile and link.
The work is motivated from ParallelForAll blog: https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/separate-compilation-linking-cuda-device-code/
This work is in progress and new features will be added in due course.
